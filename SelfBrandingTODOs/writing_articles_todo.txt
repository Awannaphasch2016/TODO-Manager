here> write and article about TODO-manager including the following topic
    how todo list can be used to help reduce collaboration friction
        how can sharding tolist help
        how to manage git repo to optimize for the seamless merge + collaboration.
    what is the golden rule of todolist (briefly explain: getting things done + my own method)
        list of action not task
        how bullet point or heirarchitcal todo list work?
            child must explain parent bullet
        todolist must be design such that it follows programming principle
            single responsibility 
            cohesion vs coupling
        you can "pause" and "resume" to the exact action that you stoppped on 
        use "here>" to indicate current action.
            each level(depth) of todo list should only have 1 'here>'
                this is simply a practical way to enable "pause-resume" property of todolist
            
put cotent in Seedling: Categroized and Synthesized - a new paradigm
of readin research.
