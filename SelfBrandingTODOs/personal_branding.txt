for research paper page, list things that I want to be searchable.
    a must.
        dataset that is being used.
        related architecutre.
        key contribution.
        picture
            table
            figure
        experiment details.
            experiments setup.
            paramters setting
            result
                performance on each dataset
                    use "performance tags"
    optional detail
        related work
            categorize by task
            categorize by dataset
            categorize by timeline
            cateogorize by model types.
        problem formation
        introduction
        summary
        equation.
            note: I really want this to be "a must" (because I am bad at it,
             and having nicely organized, I can learn better.),
            but I can't an easy way
                for it.
            note: papers use differnt symbol for the same concept, so symbol
             should be in the papers, and
            how to capture equation proof?
            how to capture process in which equation is derived?
                top-down vs bottom-up
                    Note: bottom-up makes its easier to understand, but
                        top-down can capture neccessary information alot
                        quickler. (due to principle of notes searchability,
                        top-down should be employed)

here> Write Categorize and Synthesize.
    reading paper or article is good to store information for the first
    time, but it is bad for you to retrived the information

list all of the pages types
    add them into Roam research syntax
list all of the tags that exists.
    add them into Roam research syntax
list all the query I use
    add them into Roam research syntax

video
    show types of pages.
    show how each tags are used.
    show list of query that I use

write article about tags design.
    types of tags?
        what are characteristic of each tag type?
figure out how to add social media to Youtube Channel.
talk about plugin that members should consider for roam


here> write an artivle on "stagnate era of note taking" explaining the fact
that
technology of note taking advancement is completely stagment.
    write about list of strategy in which people make notes.
    whrite about "what is the properties of good notes?"
    write about "what is the problem with the current notes taking technique?"
        style of note taking in 'fact heavy', 'concept heavy', 'domain
        syntax heavy'
make tutorial on how to intiaate 'discussion', and 'conversation' tags

wrtie in roam research under seedling: should I purposed idea of IDE for note
taking (for
curated
knowledge)
    what should be funcationality of IDE for curated knowledge?
        basic function of bi-directaion link (basically roam research)
            allow for more complex query that what is current offer in roam
            research
                what are other functionality of query do I want?
        easy way to convert equation into "latex" or "wolfram language"
        separate block types by tags.
            Note: types of tags should be add on.
            use case
            introduction
            ...
        optimize searchability + cohension + coupling + DRY.
        integrate smoothly with internet or other people's knowledge base
            navigation between internet and IDE.
        integrate smoothly with online notes. (PDF, jpg, code)
            note: all steps are saved, and can be refered to.
            when highlight a note
            -> ask if you want to re-written it in
            your own word
            -> become a block in which can be link by the rest
             of your knowledge base.
        include version control for ease of collaboration.
        have add-on to enhance
            synthesize, categorization, and exploration experience.
        enable keybinding such as vim, emacs, etc.
        built in space everything.
        built in "add to" command (blocks that are added are list in order
        or unorder)
            "add to reading list", "add to research idea", "add
             to
            syntehsize"
        built in task management
            Note: this help keeping "notes" and "folder" in the same places
        have API to other platform such as google cloud, google calendar.
            note: this is so that IDE can focus on curated the knowledge only.


write aricle to answer the following question
    Question: is the new seedling page [Seedling: Document your level of code
    understanding by writing narrative.] another to describe to capture sequence
    diagram?
        ans same idea but doesn't use any component or class to describe. only
        care about hwo the works work.

How can I start writing blog + upload to youtube consistently? (all data science related.)
    do things that I am currently not good at.
        what should I write about?
            things related to research paper, side project, contribute to open source.
                 what will be focus to my research?
                      NLP? vision? knowledge graph?
            > write about kaggle competition, so I can learn data science skill


        how long should each blog test?
            weekly blog + daily update seems reasonable

create a routine that will make me focus on research + my side project + learning.
    time blocking?

    create a prototype to test tmr
