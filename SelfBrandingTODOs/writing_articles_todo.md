# WAITING

# OPTIMIZATION
* note:
    * no need to be done right now, but if it is done it will be better.

# TODO


* here> write the following on my blog
    * title: "how to enable CUDA NVIDIA GPU in wsl2 for deep learning"
    * Seedling: Categroized and Synthesized - a new paradigm
    * write and article about TODO-manager including the following topic
        * how todo list can be used to help reduce collaboration friction
            * how can sharding tolist help
            * how to manage git repo to optimize for the seamless merge + collaboration.
        * what is the golden rule of todolist (briefly explain: getting things done + my own method)
            * list of action not task
            * how bullet point or heirarchitcal todo list work?
                * child must explain parent bullet
            * todolist must be design such that it follows programming principle
                * single responsibility 
                * cohesion vs coupling
            * you can "pause" and "resume" to the exact action that you stoppped on 
            * use "here>" to indicate current action.
                * each level(depth) of todo list should only have 1 'here>'
                    * this is simply a practical way to enable "pause-resume" property of todolist
