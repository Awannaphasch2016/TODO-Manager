Cloud App Examples
    Let me write some here
    1 - CTVS Web app
    Main goal was to give restricted access to users based on ROLES
    a - ADMIN b - REGISTERED c - AUTHORIZED
    - Bulk CSV import for adding bulk users to DynamoDB and Cognito (Lambda + API Gateway)
    - Bulk user Role change

    2 - FeeditForward Mobile App (Food donation app)...Donor can donate foods, and needy persons can book these foods (1 per 6 hours)
    we used
    -DynamoDB for data,
    -API gateway for communication b/w client side and backend
    -S3 for keeping listing and user images
    -API Gateway Websocket for realtime messaging
    -Pinpoint for real time notifications
    -SES for important mails
    -AppSync for fetching data from multiple tables at same time
    -Cognito for user authentication
