> how to set .vimrc in the cluster??  ( high priority because I cant work directly on the cluster) 


waiting to join slack via email: 
	: if by 2pm, no respond, resubmitted and 

clineicla effectiveness -> vaccine finding 

task-ts = work related to time serires prediction and forecasting of coronavirus

task-geo = help us understand how geography affect virality

task-vt = what do we know about vaccines and therapeutics

task-risk = what do we know about coid-19 risk factors? 
task-ties = what is known about transmission, incubation,adn environemntal stability? 

> what is the relationsihp between SARs and Covid? 
	: covid-19 caused by a sars-cov2 corona virus
> idea to work on 
	: use location and rate of change of cases to predict infected rate.
		: What is the best DL tools?
			:GCN? 
> understanding library and method taht daniel wolfram uses.
	: how did he preprocess with NKLP?
		: tagger vs parser vs ner?
	: cluster is selected with k_nearest neighnour.
