# NOTE
* best way to do space repeition in roam research
    * whenever, i see something i want to remember, put tags to make it resurface in the future, and tags about what it is 
        so I can filter by tags later on certain days.
# TODO 
* here> see if there are any thing from box1 - box 5 in roam research that i want to migrate to roam .
    * here> migrate content + space repeition implemenation (;daily) from box to use roam tool kit insteads.
* setting clear goal to do space repetition.
    * note 
        * for each of the following point, assign time to each point. 
    * how many question?
    * review weak point from previous day 
        * read text book to get more missing information 
        * watch video
    * work through new flashcards (or today flashcard)
* when reading survey paper, do the following 
    * survey          = skim
    * rephase         = feynman technique ( if I can't just copy and paste phase that i think is important)
        * example 
            * further direction.
            * key contribution.
            * important findings.
    * create question = practice problem
    * recall          = flashcard.
    * repetition      = space repeition
* create flashcard repeition as followed
    * in roam research, create flashcard about information in roam research.
    * in vim, create flashcard about information in paper-summary, and blog.
* summarized the following into flashcard in roam research 
    * geographic location.
    * history.
    * book that I have read.
    * language
    * coding syntax.
    * deep learning rule of thumb
