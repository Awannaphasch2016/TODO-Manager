    1 testing out new paradigm of reading research paper: Categorize and
    Synthesize
    2. First every curated knowledge base attempt at scale. Currently active member is 3 by the end of the year we aiming to have 10 active members

#==QUESTION
#=====================
Q: what is the differet between graph gernative entwork and graph auto-encoder?

Q: how does graph auto-encoder learn node pair-wise edge?

Q: how to implement "constraint" in GAN?

Q: what is the application of graph geenrative model?

        Note: different modality can live in the same manifold. This also
            implies that many manifold can live inside of hamning space.

    understand the overlapping and research area avaible in the following

    fields: network analysis, deep learning, cyber bully OR misinforation
        Problem: the main problem right now is that I don't see alot of paper on
         focus on the overlapping of the 3 fields, and i am not sure how to
         find dataset that is misinformation + network.

write the following in roam research under seedling: [[Research

    add the following into reading session
        reding session should have 3 types:
            1. read wider
                note: read new architecture idea UNRELATED to my project
            2. read deeper
                note: read paper realted to my GOAL.
            3. read fundamental
                note: read stuff that will help me understand fundamental
                concept that beyon "deep learning" fields such as math proof.
        there there should be 2 practices session for "read deeper" and
        "read wider".
