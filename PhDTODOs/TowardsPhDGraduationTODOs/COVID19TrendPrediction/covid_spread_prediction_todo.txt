read how i learn to love HDF5 Or How I Learned To Love Data Compression And Partial I/O
    here> how is hdf5 related to sparse matric implementation?

doesn't seem like it is worth learning for my case

implement GAM (generalized additive model) ?

put survey on overleaf. (draft)
    can I automate this?


create baseline for the https://www.kaggle.com/anakwanna/covid-19-forecast-baseline-model/edit
    Goal: focusing on showing what I have done.

        what is the traning set that is used for LSTM model
        when is train re-assigned.
    what are baseline model for regression?
        here> look at the papers that I have read, what are baselinesi that they used?
        implement 2-3 more. (should have about 1 hour to complete all)

    once finish, with the global dataset work on USA datase
    should I refer to the paper I read and see what is the next direction i need to do?
