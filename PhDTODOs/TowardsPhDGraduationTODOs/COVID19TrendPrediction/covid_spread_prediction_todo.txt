hdf5 and data compression related content 
    read how i learn to love HDF5 Or How I Learned To Love Data Compression And Partial I/O
        here> how is hdf5 related to sparse matric implementation?

    doesn't seem like it is worth learning for my case 
        here> try to complete the hdf5 kaggle 
            https://www.kaggle.com/tanderton/hdf5-conversion-for-fast-data-loading
        learn sparse matric

    working with many dataset in machine learning project
        hdf5 (with hiercical structure) vs h5py (data storage)?
        here> whhen to use hdf5 ?
            when to use hdf5
            learn about hdf5
                what small project to run? (deep learning related)

            what is the common problem of hdf5?
            how to load zip file to pandas without unzip it first? 
            how to convert in-memeory dataframe to HDF5 using compression
            sparse matrices make machine learning faster


    figure out a way to manage files using hdf5

how to loop through the all the states?

here> understand and run https://machinelearningmastery.com/xgboost-for-time-series-forecasting/ 
implement GAM (generalized additive model) ?

put survey on overleaf. (draft)
    can I automate this?


create baseline for the https://www.kaggle.com/anakwanna/covid-19-forecast-baseline-model/edit
    Goal: focusing on showing what I have done.
    here>understand detail + shape of train and test dataset.
        what is the traning set that is used for LSTM model
        when is train re-assigned.
    what are baseline model for regression?
        here> look at the papers that I have read, what are baselinesi that they used?
        implement 2-3 more. (should have about 1 hour to complete all)

    once finish, with the global dataset work on USA datase
    should I refer to the paper I read and see what is the next direction i need to do?  

figure out how to intepret ARIMA and understand the following does
