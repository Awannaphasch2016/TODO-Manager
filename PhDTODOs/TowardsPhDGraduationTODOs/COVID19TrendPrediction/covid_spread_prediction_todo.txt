implement GAM (generalized additive model) ?

1.focus on state level
2.varying sliding window
3.put survey on overleaf. (draft)
    can I automate this?

create baseline for the https://www.kaggle.com/anakwanna/covid-19-forecast-baseline-model/edit
    Goal: focusing on showing what I have done.
    here>understand detail + shape of train and test dataset.
        what is the traning set that is used for LSTM model
        when is train re-assigned.
    what are baseline model for regression?
        here> look at the papers that I have read, what are baselinesi that they used?
        implement 2-3 more. (should have about 1 hour to complete all) 
            option 
                basic baseline
                    Autoregressive (AR)
                    here> Moving Average (MA)
                    Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)
                    Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
                    Exponential Smoothing (ES)
                deep learning baseline
                    MLP
                state of art machine learning 
                    XGBoost (gradient boosting tree.)
                statistical basline model
                    GAM
            selected: 
                here> MA
                    how to use MA to predict linear reegression?
                    using the price of the previous day
                MLP
                XGBoost
                GAM

    once finish, with the global dataset work on USA datase
    should I refer to the paper I read and see what is the next direction i need to do?  

figure out how to intepret ARIMA and understand the following does
