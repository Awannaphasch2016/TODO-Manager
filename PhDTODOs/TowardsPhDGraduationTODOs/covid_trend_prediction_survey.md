        * [[re-writte]] collect all papers using demographics, geographics information.
            * For today (03/03), can you collect a set of papers (e.g., 10 papers) which consider using demographics, geographics information for prediction? You can include these papers in your overleaf project.
                Also have a summary in the write-up. 
            * You need to build basis to understand what are the available methods
    * message 2 
        * note 
            * put these 'info' into 'Dataset' section
        * [[re-written]] multi-variate data, single variate data. Model on each state (no info of other state), Model train on all states (include model of all states).
            * You need to have a clear thought about what are information available to make the prediction.
             One source of information is to use the infection number only (single variant). This is similar to what you are doing now. The training is based on a single time series (a stateâ€™s infection), and the learning may use other states (but all states are considered independent).
             Other approaches may use multivariant data, such as social medica data, demographic and geographic data etc. This becomes a multi-variant prediction problem. Again, the states may be considered independent.
             Other approach may consider sites/states are dependent variants. So they are forming a graph or a network. This will be solutions relying on graph neural network etc.
             Further, approaches, may consider states to be related and also to have demographic/content information etc.
            * Having a clear throught will help you organize your survey
    * message 3
        * You also need to report results in a more scientific way.
        Adding training day range (e.g., using five days to train, and predict future days. Then expand the window to using 10 days to train and predict future days). In this way, you can understand how does trend impact on the results.
        Adding a longer future days to predict. Short prediction (next day, next 5, or 7days are fairly straightforward. You can expand to next week, next 2 week, 3, week, 4 week prediction).
        Please oraganize the results in a summarized form. Currently, I had to use average to the excel file to compare them.
        * It would be good, if you can put all such data together.

        * comment 
            * You need to have a clear logic when writing a survey paper. Work out an
                architecture of the Introduciton in your mind, then carry out the writing. It
                should speak out like a story with logics advancing from one paragraph to
                another paragraph.
        * here> introduction   
            * Explain that networks and interactions are the key for pandemics outbreaks.
                * It also decides the outbreak and spread speed of the pandemics.
                    * For example, explain traditional SIR model, explain that the contact networks was
                        nherentljy assumed.
            * here> what are the major components of pandemics (such as pathogens, hosts, interactions etc).
            * Explain that recent study has advanced networks to more advanced fields (in addition to
                traditional SIR, or ESIR models). Explain what networks can be done to advance pandemics
                study, such as prediction of the infections, study drug repoposing etc.
                * add more content of this to related works too.
            * Explain what are the motivation of this survey (many works have been done in this area.
                This study try to provide a comprehensive survey, caregorize different methods etc).
        * related works 
            * Review the paper about pandemics and networks (rather raditional approach reviewing
                networks for pandemics). Explain different of your paper from those existing work.
        * networks and epidemic models
            * This is the section you will propose four tier network survey architecture.
    * https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/QgrcJHrhxnlBBDbfZPTXGVlBgkGCGJzNdcg 
        * Instead, focus on scientific characteristics of pandemics vs. epidemics
        * I need to add details about: what are the major components of pandemics (such as
            pathogens, hosts, interactions etc).  How they function together, with similar
            networking mechanism. This motivates researchers to consider different pandemics models.
        * Explain that recent study has advanced networks to more advanced fields (in
            addition to traditional SIR, or ESIR models). Explain what networks can be done to
            advance pandemics study, such as prediction of the infections, study drug repoposing
            etc.

    * problem of epidemic forecasting
        1. few data -> models must be good at learning from low number of data
                  eg. transfer learning
        2. few data (from each source) + many data sources (heterogenous data) -> data from each source must be calibrated \ 
        model must be good at learning from hetergenous data + each data sources may contains different types of noise
        3. use similation to get more data -> model must be able to learn from simulated data + simulated data must represent "real data"

* look into the following topics. 
    * transfer learning
        * what are the types of transfer learning model?
    * transformer
    * embedding 
        * time seires embeding 
        * pandemic (viral) embedding
    * heterogenous input
    * limited dataset (low volume of dataset)
    * knowledge distillation
