# TODO

* here> compare performance of purposed methods to the baseline methods  
    * implement lstm and GRU baseline
        * here> baseline is GRU on stock prediction
            * herE> https://medium.com/swlh/stock-price-prediction-with-pytorch-37f52ae84632#:~:text=Stock%20market%20prediction%20is%20the,value%20of%20a%20company%20stock.&text=Here%20we%20are%20going%20to,terms%20of%20time%20and%20efficiency.

    * here> implement purposed model  
        * here> visualize graph embedding per time step
            * here> how to visualize node2vec
                * here> plot matplotlib animation. 
                    * here> convert embedding values 
        * for each time step, pass to node2vec then to lstm
