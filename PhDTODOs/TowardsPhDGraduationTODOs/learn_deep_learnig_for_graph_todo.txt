for all the papers, I can do the following
    1. collect paper into group and select from each category.
        criteria for group type are
            1. dataset used
            2. task they are solving
            3. deep learning model.
    2. skim only methodology of each papers with out in-depth details.

things that I hvane't seen done
    using new graph neural network technique (model) on the new task
    network of companies itself
        note: current construct network from news.
    using company's properties such as PE value to calculate.
    analyze hierarchical graph as followed
        note: markets are moved by money, and money is circulated in more than
            1 industry and assets
        from top to bottom
            network of correlation between financial assets
            network of correlation between industry (given 1 assets)
            network of correlation between network (given 1 industry)
    using other financial asset in the graph
    aspect analysis
    given the same network, using multi-feature edges. (using different way to
     calculate 'relationship' between nodes)
        note: 'relationship' is not limited to correlation.
    using directed edges.
        caustion graph??
    I want to trace credibility of an entity. and use them to predict.
        note: problem here is aligning prediction time frame.
            to detect this, check date between buy and sell. (percentage left
                from the initial buy => indicate short-long term? confident?)
        social follow trading website
            https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-social-stock-trading-site-yet
        is there a social network where people predict stock/finance asset?
            if there is, creditbility network can be created there.
                using temporal network, user who predicted correctly will gain more
                 "credits"
                reference: from Radalio hypocrecy (not sure about the word)
                thinking
    using relation data
    use all aspect sentiment analysis toward all aspects that drive value of
     that industry
        eg. oil is effected by fosil, coutry who have control of oil, whether.
    detect maeket manipulator



is there a way to plot citation of a selected paper?
    if I do this, it will be easy to collect paper that related.

Goal: collect snippet and understand ways people approach the problem.

    Goal: reproduce the performance from scratch.
    May be 'temporal' is a key word to get graph like dataset?

find misinformation dataset that I can create network out of and do analysis
 on it.
