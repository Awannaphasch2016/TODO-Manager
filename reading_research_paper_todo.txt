here> understand the overlapping and research area avaible in the following
fields: network analysis, deep learning, cyber bully OR misinforation
    Problem: the main problem right now is that I don't see alot of paper on
     focus on the overlapping of the 3 fields, and i am not sure how to
     find dataset that is misinformation + network.

    read survey paper on deep learning + network analysis + cyber bullying
    OR misinformation
