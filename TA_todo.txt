        no video provided. I cannot grade. Once video is submitted. submit or
         comment link tpo the video and I will update the grade.

          After lab 2,
          I cannot update the score after the deadline, so please keep that
          in mind. Also please submit your .asm file, so I can provide
          partial point whenever possible.

        Answer from video submission is incorrect. you need to submit the code
        for me to check for correctess and recieved partial point.

    comment
        video demonstration is not correct, please submit code for partial
            credit.

        1. code seems fine
        2. no video submission I can't provide grade.
        3. if code doesn't run because wire is incorrect, I need
            picture of wiring to provide partial credit.

        Please send me email regarding help.
        submissios section should only contains things related to your submission.

                    No explanation was provided on why LED1 is not flickering (-2).
                    If the room temperature reading increases by 2% over the room value, LED 2 turns on. Currently in your code, it should increase by 3%.
                    When you touch the touch switch, LED 3 should toggle ON or OFF and stays in that case until your next touch (-2).


    quiz
        resubmission quiz Hunter Grant on Canvas?


check canvas

making annoucment to ask if anyone hasn't yet get their grade from lab
    0-lab 5?
        everyone should have thier grade from lab 0 to lab 5. If I still
         miss anyone else please email me

send email to dr Alhabi to see if he will be grading it.
    I believe that TA is not responsible to grade quizes, but Quiz 4-7
        has yet been updated, so i am slightly concerned for students.
