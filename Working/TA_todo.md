## Grading criteria

* lab 0
    * Anak
        * -1 for not submitting the video.
        * -0.5 b) 10 is decimal not hex.
    * Andrei
        * -0.5 for not explaining the code
        * -0.5 for not running parts b) and c) in the video 
        * -0.5 on part b) for using hex 10 instead of decimal 10 (in the memory browser you can switch the
            view to 16 or 8 bit signed int and you will see that the value you entered is decimal 16).
    * Alhajab
        * -1 Make sure you show how to apply
        all parts in the lab0 manual with showing the results?
            * update: 
                * make it -0.5 instead because of Andrei criteira
                    * -0.5 for not running parts b) and c) in the video 

* lab 1
    * note:
        * change from 11.25 to 14. before the following condition is softer
            * -1 for the video because you did not explain the code. Please submit a video where you explain what
                the instructions do.
    * Anak
        * -0.5 recorded values after program had ran is incorrect.
        * -4 for no video submission.
            * update:
                * change from -4 to -3.75 because I did gave -3.75 for the same reason previously
        * -1 you didn't show output in the video. 
        * subtract 50 percent if value is missing.
        * weird cases
            * -2 you put address as answer not value.
    * Andrei
        * -1 for the video because you did not explain the code. Please submit a video where you explain what
            the instructions do.
        * -3 The values you entered for registers R5 and R6 and the result in R7 are incorrect. Please check
            the lab sheet for the values you need to enter.
        * -0.5 for wrong result in R6, because you moved "010" to R6, which, if you look in the register view,
            is actually decimal or hexadecimal 8. When you put 0 before a number, that signifies that the
            number is written in octal notation (base 8), and 10 octal is 8 decimal. Please be careful about
            this in the future.

* lab 2

    * Anak 
        * give 5/20; everything is wrong + no video.
        * -1: you wrote dec not hex
        * -1: no lab sheet submitted, but everything is correct in video.
        * -4 no lab sheet is provided.
        * -2 code is wrong 
        * weird case
            * -0.5: everything works but code is just weird.
    * Andrei 
        * good enough 
            * -4 for part b) First of all, you should have 11 bytes on each line. Your answers are completely
                wrong.
                -2 for not explaining even the part that you had for the sorting subroutine
            * -1 for part b) because you did not write the correct values on the lab sheet.
            * -5 Your video does not show the program actually running. It is not sufficient to say that you
                already ran the code because you could have entered those values manually. Please upload a short
                video showing the code running (you do not need to redo the whole thing again).
            * -5 for not explaining the code. I know how bubble sort works, I don't need to see it executing step
                by step. I want to know if you understand what each step of the code does and if you can explain
                how you wrote it. Please upload a short video with the explanation for the full grade.
            * -0.3 for part a) because one of the elements in the second array is wrong.
            * here> -8 for part a) for the Sort subroutine (it does not sort the whole array).
    * Alhajab
        * First element (10 "0A in hex") is to determine the number of elements in the array, so it has to be
            in the first after ordering. (-2)

* lab 3
    * note:
        * check people who has score = 0.
    * Anak

                * 10/20 if no video submitted at all + lab sheet is right.
        * -2 code explaination is just plain bad. (doesn't show any understanding what so ever .)
    * Andrei 
        * comment
            * -2 is used when asnwer is incorrect.
        * need adjustment 
        * good enough
            * -4 for not showing parts c) and d) running along with the obtained results
            * -0.5 because you used rrc instead of an arithmetic instruction for division.
            * -2 for part a) because the code is not entirely correct.
            * -5 for not explaining the code
            * -3, -1 for each of parts b), c), and d) because the answers are wrong. You need to account 
             for the 0! yourself in the code.
            * -2 for part e). Perform the calculation manually and check your result in part d) to see why.
            * -8 for parts b), c), d), and e) because the results are wrong.
            * -10 because you did not explain any of the code + don't show code.
            * -6 for part a) because the you are obtaining incorrect results in the video (yet you have correct
                ones on the sheet).

    * Alhajab
        * (-2)
        The maximum value of (a) is 7. To proof it, let us find the result of (a=8) >> 65,000.
        Notice that 65,000 cannot be handled by 16 bit register (word long register) (65K > 216
        * 3.b) a=5 >>(-2)
        * 3.c) a=6 >>(-2)
        * 3.d) incorrect answer
        You got incorrect answers because of the mathematical problem.
        to do that repeat the loop with a-1, a-2 (in R5) till lower value a=0
        and write the factorial subroutine
        ;you start with value n in R6, then multiply with n-1, n-2, ..1
        ;use the MULT subroutine to multiply R5 to R6 registers
        make sure you add (0!=1) since i starts from a to end with 0

        * 5/20; board doesn't work + code works (or not working) + code is explained.
        * -2 doesn't show that value loop correctly.
    * Andrei 
        * -10 because you did not explain any of the code + don't show code.
        * -5 for not explaining the code
        * -3 because when counting up or down with both digits, the numbers that have a 0 as the right digit
            are skipped. Please fix the code and show the lab running with that part fixed for these points.
        * -8 for part 5.c) because none of those switch combinations are doing what they are supposed to. 101
            and 110 should RECALL, not STORE, the preset value. 100 and 111 should count by 1s, not by 10s
        * -1 because the 2 digits are switched around. That is a rather simple fix (either change the digits
            in the code or swap the wires of the transistors that the common cathodes connect to).
        * -1 for part 5.c) because you didn't show the counting up to 90 and repeating
        * -1 because you did not clearly show and explain the code for combination 111.
        * -2.5 for part 5.c) because switch combination 111 is not working and because you did not show switch
            combination 100 counting to 90 and then restarting from a preset value (please choose a preset
            value in the range 11-79).
        * -2 for part 5.c) because switch combination 111 is not shown to be working.
        * -1 for 111 because the digits are switched around. This should be an easy fix (it seems that you
            just need to switch the wires controlling the transistors).
    * Alhajab
        * you switched between left and right (the numbers are in opposite order) you didn't test the 111 for count down to 10
        * 5.c) Counter counts up or down •SW-321 = 111: Counter cycles down from the preset value to 10, and
            repeats •SW-321 = 101: Recall the preset value •SW-321 = 110: Recall the preset value •SW-321 =
            100: Counter cycles up from the preset value to 90, and repeats
        * -20 you need to record the breadboard changes not only the code
