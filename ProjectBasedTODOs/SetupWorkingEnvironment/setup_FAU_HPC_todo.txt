    can I get debugging to work?

setup my working environment

        add alias 'config' to .zshrc
            refer to the following for more detail: 
                https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
        create branch. (to keep the differences in dotfiles separate)
            main
            anak_laptop
            fau_cluster 
                add files + folder + resource (resource must be in README.md ) require to duplicate the environment
                    add Document/SetUpWorkingEnvironment/ and files required
                in README.md, add 'requirement to use this branch'
                    requirement includes the following  
                        no access to sudo command
                        base terminal = CentOS
                        vim version = 7.4

        On the cloud, check for changes of the following files. 
            .zshrc
            .bashrc
            .vimrc
        before 'config checkout' (move dotfiles to old_dotfile/ManagebyGitBare/
        make sure that the following files are in_sync
            .zshrc
            .bashrc
            .vimrc
    enable vifm on the terminal
