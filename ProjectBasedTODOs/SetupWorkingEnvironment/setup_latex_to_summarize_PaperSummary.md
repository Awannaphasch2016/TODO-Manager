    * requirements
        * tools
            * Inkscape
                * drawing picture
            * Mathpix
    * here> look into Gilles Castel's github to get overview of tools he uses/implements. (this allow me to expandas and add my own creativity in to the mix)
    * implement shortcuts for symbols that I see often in research paper
        * figure out a system to type latex symbols intuitively and in sync with how human think (writing from left to right)
    * practice writing in latex
        * note
            * if skills to master takes too much time, give up and just use mathpix. (less flexible because not all tools has it but it is pretty damn good)
        * ref
            * collect equation in all papers for covid19survey (syntax that I will encounter more often)
        * practice on it one by one.
