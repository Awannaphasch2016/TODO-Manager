    * note 
        * there are so much stuff in doom emacs. it is difficult to know which error cause by emacs and which error caused by the additional layers)

# GOAL 

- goal of learning emacs is to understand mechanism behind how packages works. NOT LEARNING TO SWITCH TO EMACS. (I have decided on 6/22/2021 to not switch to emacs because it doesn't worth the effort) 
    *  exception TODO manager which I should completely switch to org-mode from markdown.

# TODO 

* here> Ultimate Goal: use emacs to create an app that can perfectly express by Garun workflow 
    * note
        - to enable automation of extract, deliver, storing.
    * here> fix colors of emacs 
    * learn how to configure emacs configuration
