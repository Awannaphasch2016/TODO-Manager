#NOTE

#QUESTION

#WAITING

#OPTIMIZATION

#TODO
* Goal: learning all the ways to write faster code (focus on Deep learning code)
    * learning gpu programming (practical: looking for code in github)
        * note
            * only allow for learning by working on code myself
        * learn Numba
