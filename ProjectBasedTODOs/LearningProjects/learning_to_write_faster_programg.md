* here> learn how to use slurm job managemen
    * here> https://hpc.fau.edu/interactive-and-gui-based-jobs/
    * https://hpc.fau.edu/fau-slurm-queues/
    * try running the following:
        * https://hpc.fau.edu/engineering-queue-gpus/
            * the article show implementation of GPU and slurm (via sbatch)
    lets run something that would require cluter and compare speed. 
        * use metrics show in this video to measure speed
            * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lKcou1-3OY&ab_channel=PyConAU at 18.49
        * how to test cluster vs non cluster speed ( this is needed to validate that cluster is being used)
        * how to test GPU vs CPU speed.
        * when using cluster does it run with CPU or GPU?
            * is this part of the configurtion that I have to set?

* Goal: learning all the ways to write faster code (focus on Deep learning code)
    * learning gpu programming (practical: looking for code in github)
        * note
            * only allow for learning by working on code myself
        * learn Numba
