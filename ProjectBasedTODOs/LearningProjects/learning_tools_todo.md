* pandas profiling
    * here> learn how to read pandas profiling report
        * here> can I pipeline output to filter out time series data for each state?
            * here> consider using pandas profiling with other tools such as 
                * here> grep/sed/awk, visidata, pandasshell
                    * here> use sed to filter for match column -> to an tmp filde (tmp/tmp.csv) -> pandasprofiling
                    * use visidata to filter only states data from florida
                    * use pandasshell
    * ToC
        * basic 
            * type, unique value, missing value

* here> lazy predict
    * here> can I use this in my project?
        * here> learn how to use lazy predict for regression?
            * here> what is the data format of lazy predict?
                * here> convert us-state.csv to git data format of lazy predict
                    * here> use visidata
                        * here> learn basic of visidata
* use streamlit to show data easily 
    * goal
        * so that I can compare results
    * here> work on data profiling + streamlit
        * get code from data professor
    * cool streamlit example for (generally useful for data science + machien learning enineer cases)
        * learn from data professor github chnnel

    * visidata vs pandashell
        * how are they different?
            * pandashell focus on combining basic command including awk, sed, grep
