# GOAL 

* list of goals of the project.
    * collaboration 
        * implement shared curated knowledge base that are smoothly integrated with my roam-research style note taking best practices 
            * note
                * my idea is to create a website (containing papers on the internet) where people upload their version of notes and attach them to the listed paper.
                    * members can interact with attached notes in each paper by review others notes, sharing it, merge it to their own notes, discuss something on it, and contact authors of the notes.
                * community should be managed follow my Garun Project post on medium.
    * note taking 
        * allow math heavy research to take notes on pdf (or linking between annotation in pdf and notes.) AND management references.
            * integration with mathpix is an interesting direction.
            * 
        * allow coder to take notes (Org file does pretty good job here)
            * see in reference workflow/zotero + rem. (This is perfection! exactly how I imaging it to be.)
    * implementation 
        * the implementation should follow emacs philosophy of 'hiding complexity'.  
        * the goal of implementation should focus on brining people from various notes taking style. (note must be in text file or pandoc convertible)
        * implementation should be on top of emacs.
            * principles and philosophy 
                * this implementation are similar to transition from perl
                    philosophy (emacs & open source & free software) to python
                    philosophy. (Garun & profit driven + emacs & open source & free software ) 
                    * perl philosophy 
                        * there are more than one way of doing things
                    * python philosophy
                        * there are at least one obvious way to do everythings.
            * note 
                * We must create a profit-driven system on top of free software
                    and open source that would allow use to develop
                    'workflow-proof' consistent and well integrated product.
                    * downside of emacs are not its efficiency and quality, but
                        lack of 'workflow-proof' consistent and well integrated product. (think of it as IDE for goal base
                        projects like note taking/data science/data base/web
                        developerment)
                * my implementation idea is to create GUI version of doom emacs with icons similar to one provided by Vscode
                    and hotkeys are first hidden, but can be turned on as users are more experience and need to be 
                    more efficient OR users take on more type of 'workflow-proof product.' For example, one may only know
                    with note taking from WYSIWYG apps, then learn to be more efficient by turning on hotkeys capabilities, 
                    Then, later, the user may want to learn data-science, the user can turn on data-science workflow and begin
                    with WYSIWYG workflow before moving on to hotkey-based data science workflow
                    * pros
                        * this provides the following advantages 
                            1. newbie who only use WYSIWYG product and use it write away.

        * implementation should focus on storing notes (in markdown or convertible files by pandoc) locally and on the cloud (to allow easy access anywhere like roam research)
        * notes should be future proof. (similar to obsidian approach)

# OPTIMIZATION

- try vim anywhere.
    - ref 
        - https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere
    - how can I use it ?

- try to replace roam research with org-roam?
    * note
        * I tried this, but org-roam is still underdeveloped and its funcationality doesn't support my workflow.

        - add here> as a Status 
    - learn basic org agenda.
        * enough to be useful. 

- create org-capture template for roam-research-template and roam-research-survey-templat and others
    - what is org-capture?


# FAQs
    
- Is it possible to implement a AI research expert on a certain domain that are capable of extract (summarize) and storing the newly extracted information into human understandable curated knowledges.?
    - note
        - the idea is that AI does the reading and storing, human consume the stored knowledge and apply critical thinking skill to generate new idea or goal-based search for certain information in the shared brain.
