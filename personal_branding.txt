for research paper page, list things that I want to be searchable.
    a must.
        dataset that is being used.
        related architecutre.
        key contribution.
        picture
            table
            figure
        experiment details.
            experiments setup.
            paramters setting
            result
                performance on each dataset
                    use "performance tags"
    optional detail
        related work
            categorize by task
            categorize by dataset
            categorize by timeline
            cateogorize by model types.
        problem formation
        introduction
        summary
        equation.
            note: I really want this to be "a must" (because I am bad at it,
             and having nicely organized, I can learn better.),
            but I can't an easy way
                for it.
            note: papers use differnt symbol for the same concept, so symbol
             should be in the papers, and
            how to capture equation proof?
            how to capture process in which equation is derived?
                top-down vs bottom-up
                    Note: bottom-up makes its easier to understand, but
                        top-down can capture neccessary information alot
                        quickler. (due to principle of notes searchability,
                        top-down should be employed)

write an article about The next species of genius.
    smart = how much you remember
    smart = how fast you access information.
        note: many things are online but most are crap, so you have to an
        ability to access the right information.
        note: you must have ability to filter for good info.
    smart = how fast you filter and retrived quality information.
        note: many things are online and there are many high quality
        content, so you have to be able to store/update when new more
        refined/previse information is discovered. (learning from best
        content.)
        note: you must have ability to retrive good info. no need to filter
        alot becaue good content is already there. just store and retrived.
write an artivle on "stagnate era of note taking" explaining the fact that
technology of note taking advancement is completely stagment.
    write about list of strategy in which people make notes.
    whrite about "what is the properties of good notes?"
    write about "what is the problem with the current notes taking technique?"
        style of note taking in 'fact heavy', 'concept heavy', 'domain
        syntax heavy'
make tutorial on how to intiaate 'discussion', and 'conversation' tags

wrtie in roam research under seedling: should I purposed idea of IDE for note
taking (for
curated
knowledge)
    what should be funcationality of IDE for curated knowledge?
        basic function of bi-directaion link (basically roam research)
            allow for more complex query that what is current offer in roam
            research
                what are other functionality of query do I want?
        easy way to convert equation into "latex" or "wolfram language"
        separate block types by tags.
            Note: types of tags should be add on.
            use case
            introduction
            ...
        optimize searchability + cohension + coupling + DRY.
        integrate smoothly with internet or other people's knowledge base
            navigation between internet and IDE.
        integrate smoothly with online notes. (PDF, jpg, code)
            when highlight a note -> ask if you want to re-written it in
            your own word -> become a block in which can be link by the rest
             of your knowledge base. (all steps are saved)
        include version control for ease of collaboration.
        have add-on to enhance
            synthesize, categorization, and exploration experience.
        enable keybinding such as vim, emacs, etc.

write aricle to answer the following question
    Question: is the new seedling page [Seedling: Document your level of code
    understanding by writing narrative.] another to describe to capture sequence
    diagram?
        ans same idea but doesn't use any component or class to describe. only
        care about hwo the works work.

How can I start writing blog + upload to youtube consistently? (all data science related.)
    do things that I am currently not good at.
        what should I write about?
            things related to research paper, side project, contribute to open source.
                 what will be focus to my research?
                      NLP? vision? knowledge graph?

        how long should each blog test?
            weekly blog + daily update seems reasonable

create a routine that will make me focus on research + my side project + learning.
    time blocking?
